###
Test Suite

Due to having to test emails for an auth code, selenium is used to automate the process.

To set up selenium run
 $ npm install -g selenium-standalone@2.43.1-2.9.0
to install  it globally.

Then, before the unit tests are run,
 $ start-selenium
should be run to set up the framework.
